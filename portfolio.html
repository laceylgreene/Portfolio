    <p> To start off this portfolio I'd like to share a bit about myself. My name is Lacey Greene and I am a 20 year old local college student. I graduated from Inglemoor High School class of 2014 and often participated in art and math clubs during my time there.
      <p>I began working in retail as a Nordstrom Cashier during my sophmore year of highschool and eventually worked my way into commissioned sales. After almost four years of various retail jobs I realized that fashion and marketing just wasn't for me and last summer began working in the food industry as a host and expoditer, which has proven to be a more fitting work place for me. However it has not turned on that green lightbulb in my head indicating that this is what I'd like to do for the rest of my life or even a large portion.
      </p>
      <p>I can't recall what triggered it but I began looking up how to code online and learning how to do some styling and editing basics. This caused that little green light to flicker and inspired me to look a little deeper into programming options outside of my regular schooling. I found out about Code Fellows from an aquaintance that completed their courses and wound up working for them. After a few not so positive reviews of their bootcamp I found Epicodus on a page of the best coding "bootcamps" in the country and decided to give it a shot. So here is a list of some of the projects I've worked on these past four weeks, including the a little bit about what I'd learned through each project. For every project I learned to use Mac Terminal, Atom, and how to create files including an html and a styling file. </p>

<ul>
      <p><li><a href="https://github.com/laceylgreene/my-first-webpage/blob/master/favorite-things.html"<strong>My First Webpage</strong></a></li> This first webpage was my first introduction to linking an html file to a css file and opening it in a browser. </p>

    <p><li><a href="https://github.com/laceylgreene/my-first-webpage/blob/master/favorite-things.html"<strong>My Blog</strong></a></li>
    In this particular project I learned how to adjust line spacing and the density of the words which I found to be factors in creating a more polished looking narrative. I also change the font size, family, weight, alignment, letter spacing and color using hex notation. </p>

        <p><li><a href="https://github.com/laceylgreene/my-first-webpage/blob/master/favorite-things.html"<strong>My First Webpage</strong></a></li> This was the first files we worked on in class. It was the first time I put what I'd practiced learning online into an actual terminal and being able to see the product in an actual tab.</p>

        <p><li><a href="https://github.com/laceylgreene/Cupcake-Mania/tree/master/CupCake-Shop"<strong>Cupcake Mania</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/laceylgreene/Resort-website/tree/master/Resort-website"<strong>Luxury Land</strong></a></li> These were two pages I began to experient with style and over all look.</p>
